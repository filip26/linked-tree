# Canonical Linked Tree Format

- **Top-Level Identifiable Nodes:**  
  Nodes with unique identifiers are maintained at the top level of the hierarchy, ensuring they are directly accessible.

- **Single-Type Nodes with Multiple Associations:**  
  Each node is assigned a single type; however, nodes of different types can be associated with one another.

- **Embedded Blank Nodes:**  
  Blank nodes (nodes without a unique identifier) remain embedded within their parent structures.

- **Direct Reference by Identifier:**  
  Nodes with unique identifiers can be directly referenced using their identifier.


```json
{
 "id|@keyword" : [
    {
       "@type": "",
       "predicate": [
        // node reference
             "id",
        // value node - leaf
         {
           "@value": , "@type": 
       },
        // blank node
       {
           "predicate": "id"
        }

        ]
     },
     {
     }
  ],
  "@root": "id" or // blank node { ... }
  
}
```
